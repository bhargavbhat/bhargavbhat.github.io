    <p>This post is just a summary of me doing a Deepawali cleaning of all of my notes, old emails, text files and Google Drive stuff and moving it all under a managable blog hosted on GitHub pages with <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/">Pelican</a>.</p>
<h4>Installation &amp; Theme Selection</h4>
<p>Pelican install was very quick and straight forward process, just follow the instructions laid out in the "quickstart" section of the docs and a fully functional, ready to serve blog was ready on my local machine. This also allowed me to try out a few themes, verify formatting (most of the posts I have were written a email, text files or shared docs, not markdown) and ensure that everything looked fine.</p>
<p>Theme selection was a slighly longer task, mostly consisted of <a href="http://www.pelicanthemes.com/">browsing</a> available options, trawling the respective github repos and picking one that clicked visually and feature-wise. Then came the testing phase of trying it on the articles and pages that I had migrated/created so far. My main criteria for theme selection were a clean design, pleasing colours, tags &amp; categories support along with a search function. Although I couldn't find one that checked all the boxes, I found that <a href="https://github.com/laughk/pelican-hss">pelican-hss</a> had all that I wanted (save the search function). I picked that theme, made a few tweaks to the supplied pygments CSS and <code>base.html</code> template and decided to call it a day.</p>
<h4>Deployment to Github Pages</h4>
<p>My previous homepage was a rather simple landing page, with links to social media profiles:
<img alt="Previous Homepage" src="/images/home_page.png"></p>
<p>and this was served out of github pages as a simple <code>index.html</code> file, forked from the html5up repo. Moving to pelican meant setting up branches slightly differently. I chose to use the <code>content</code> branch to contain all of the Pelican stuff.</p>
<h4>Learning</h4>
<p>The real power, flexibility &amp; convenience of static hosting is apparent from all of the personal blogs and project pages hosted on GH pages. For me, a lot of the learning was around pelican,setting up venv right and migrating content</p>
<h4>Road Ahead</h4>
<p>A lot of my old notes, shared docs and learning are still scattered all over platforms. Although not too many public/shared posts and notes exist, I still have to sift through them all, deal with dead links and filter out stuff that's relevant and applicable to a wider audience. Most of the notes that I have are specific to the particular teams, products or siutations. I've gotten thru a few of these notes and will continue to add them to the site as fast as I can. As I make my way around this old stuff, a lot more posts should start popping up on the homepage. </p>
<p>PS: Dates and stuff for these old posts is from file meta data, may not be 100% accurate. Stuff that was once WIP has likely been abandoned and/or is no longer relevant. Links have been updated and dead links removed (where applicable). If you find something odd or inaccurate, please do reach out. :)</p>
