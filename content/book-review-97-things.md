Summary: My review of 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know

I came across an interesting [link](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/) earlier this week, an online book titled `97 Things Every Programmer Should Know`. It was presented in a format familar to readers of the `More Effective` series by Scott Meyers, viz. a series of loosely related items or topics presented in a numbered manner. The reader however, is free to jump around and read topics that interest them the most. I personally find this approach to organizing books very helpful.

Of the various topics and anecdotes presented, I found these the most relevant and impactful (personally):

- *Boy Scout Rule* : leave code a _little_ better than how you found it
- *Beauty in Simplicity* : simple code is beautiful
- *Code Reviews* : as a regular activity to share knowledge, establish common patterns and conduct walkthroughs with the purpose of understanding the flow
- *Deploy Early and Often*  : view deployment as an integral part of the SDLC and have deployment process in place alongside development/refactoring
- *Learn to Estimate* : distinguish between `estimate` , `target` and `commitment`. Ensure all stakeholders have the same understanding wrt these terms
- *Read Code*
- *Write Tests for People* : tests as a guide to understanding code and practice of testing your tests

While I did see a good amount of overlap between this book and `The Pragmatic Programmer`, there were several items here that were new and interesting.
