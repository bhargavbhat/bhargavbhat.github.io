Summary: Review of the 


I completed [UT.6.0x Embedded Systems - Shape the World](https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.6.02x/1T2015/course/) from edX earlier this week. This course has a comprehensive treatment of all of the important concepts in embedded systems - both in theory and the lab exercises. I would definitely recommend folks with CS/IS/IT background looking to a get a headstart in Embedded Systems to complete this course.

Some of the topics/material covered included:

- Fundamentals of Electronics : Discrete components and Digtal Logic
- Programming in C
- Microcontrollers : I/O, Interfacing LEDs & Switches and the Design & Development Process
- Peripherals & Misc : UART, DAC, ADC, Interrupts
- Intro to Wireless Radios & IoT

**Notes on the Lab :** The course uses Kiel uVision IDE for the lab and recommends that students have the LaunchPad board to complete the lab exercises on. However, the instructors have provided a simulator facility to target the lab exercises and complete them without having to procure the board.
