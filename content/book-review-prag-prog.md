Summary: My review of The Pragmatic Programmer

While browsing around for books casually today, I found an almost-new copy of "The Pragmatic Programmer" today. Although I was looking for bargains on fiction and non-fiction titles and not necessarily programming and tech books, I found it too hard to pass on the deal. It was a 2013 reprint (lucky!) with ISBN: 978-81-317-2242-9. The paper quality was ok-ish and there weren't any markings left by the previous owner (very lucky!).

As I got home and read the Foreword and the Preface, I was pleasently surprised. It wasn't a preachy "do-X-for-Efficiency" book that I expected it to be. Instead, it read easy and had a lot of sensible advice even before the main content of the book began! Being the easy read it was and the no-nonsense message it carried, I found the book very hard to put down and got through the material (minus the Appendix) in less than a week :)

More than a "review", I intend for this note to be a personal refresher or reference card that I can get back to every so often. With that said, here are the most important maxims (IMHO) after the first read of this book (oh, I'm definitely going to read it a few times over and update this notes file as I peel more layers away):

- Care About Your Craft
- Provide Options, not excuses
- Don't Live with Broken Windows
- Remember the Big Picture
- Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
- Analyze What You Read and Hear
- Make It Easy to Reuse
- There Are No Final Decisions
- Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
- Program Close to the Problem Domain
- Estimate & Iterate the Schedule with the Code
- Keep Knowledge in Plain Text
- Use the Power of Command Shells
- Use a Single Editor Well
- "select" Isn't Broken.
- Don't Assume, Prove It
- Write Code That Writes Code
- You Can't Write Perfect Software
- Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata
- Refactor Early, Refactor Often
- Work with a user to think like a user
- Organize Teams Around Functionality
- Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically
- Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations
- Sign Your Work

This book was amazing and I only wish I could have found it sooner in my career. All of the advice is generic, seemingly common sense, yet very practical and grounded. I would gladly recommend it it anyone looking at programming and software development as a hobby. This book is right up there with K&R C and the Design of the UNIX Operating System in terms of the impact that it has personally had on me.
