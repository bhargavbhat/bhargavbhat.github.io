Summary: A chance encounter with Darktable and dabbling with this interesting tool

Since I got hold of a DSLR a little over 3years ago and years of using loaners before that, I've been using [rawtherapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com/) to process the raw files from cameras. I started with v4.2 of the program and I'm currently using v5.6 that was released just a few months ago. It works well with Shotwell and produces pretty good results. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccUv02QFMxs) tutorial covers the worflow for rawtherapee.

I mostly use rawtherapee for basic edits : slight exposure tweaks, crops and the occasional horizon straightening. Along with the usual suspects: noise reduction, profiled lens correction, whitebalance, contrast & saturation. Today, I was looking at getting a few more of my old raw files processed and before I started the process, I first wanted to see a summary video or two of the new stuff in v5.6. However, the YouTube suggestion algorithm had a different fate planned and surfaced [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv8yKb0oLJM) interesting video, and that was how I was introduced to darktable :)

After spending most of the day looking into more darktable videos (instead of actually working on the raw files), here is what I was able to take away:

- darktable and rawtherapee use a bunch of the same libraries to get a lot of the "plumbing" done. Each has a different approach though.
- darktable supports one feature (still) missing in rawtherapee : masks for selective application of edits
- darktable supports one other feature (still) missing in rawtherapee : spot-removal (handy to get rid of dustbins and such)
- darktable has a batch-processing capability (copy/paste/save history) for quickly dealing with a bunch of similar images, similar to Paste Partial, but more granular
- darktable has a cleaner UI (reminiscent of Lightroom) and a "favourites" options to pin/arrange tools as per your liking

... so does that mean I'm moving over to darktable? Well, just like with the whole vim vs nvim thing a couple of years ago, I'll probably have both installed for a while and then make a choice based on what "feels" right after a few months of use :)
