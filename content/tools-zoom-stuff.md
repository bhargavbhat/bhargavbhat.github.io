Summary: Keyboard shortcuts for navigating zoom

With zoom becoming the reality, here's a cheatsheet of useful zoom shortcuts (some learnt the hardway and most from looking at the options):

- `Command + Shift + A` : toggle mute (can be set as global setting with a diff combo, eg: `Command + Shift + 1`)
- `Command + Shift + T` : pause screenshare
- `Command + U` : show participants list
- `Option + Y` : Raise hand or lower hand

Full documentation [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205683899-hot-keys-and-keyboard-for-zoom), or just goto zoom preferences and adjust keyboard shortcuts directly within the application.
