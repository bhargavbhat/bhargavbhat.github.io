Summary: My list of Books to Read

After reading the Effective C++ book from Scott Meyers last year, I wanted to build a list of programming books, focused on C, C++ and UNIX/Linux that I wanted to read. This is that list in no particular order:

### General

- [x] Mythical Man Month
- [x] Code Complete
- [ ] Clean Coder
- [ ] Pragmatic Programmer
- [ ] Design Patterns (GoF book)
- [ ] Designing Object Oriented Software

### C/C++

- [x] K&C C
- [x] C++ Programming Language
- [x] Effective C++
- [ ] More Effective C++
- [ ] Effective STL
- [ ] C++ Standard Template Library
- [ ] Algorithms in C++
- [ ] C++ FAQs
- [ ] Exceptional C++
- [ ] More Exceptional C++

### UNIX/Linux

- [ ] The Design of the UNIX Operating System
- [ ] Linux Kernel Development

### Misc

- [ ] Scheme Programming Language
- [ ] Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs
- [ ] Introduction to Algorithms 
- [ ] Learning DCOM

I don't intend to review or write about all of these books, maybe a few that I found the most impactful personally.
