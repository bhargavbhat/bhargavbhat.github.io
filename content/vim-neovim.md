Summary: NeoVim - a vim challenger?

Today, I came across [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) which is a project that forks from the vim sources, cleans up a lot of the cruft from supporting esoteric platforms and operating systems and adds a bunch of really handy features like `:terminal`. It also boasts of a new Plugin API (backwards compatible with the old plugins and VimL). All in all, neovim bills itself as the "good parts" of vim. [This](https://geoff.greer.fm/2015/01/15/why-neovim-is-better-than-vim/) blog post goes into the details of what NeoVim brings to the table.

As a long term user of vim, I'm glad that this choice exists and that the cruft of systems long dead is not holding back the development of vim, albeit as a fork. Personally, I'm not decided on whether to switch or not. Maybe I'll try it for a few weeks at home and see how things pan out :)
