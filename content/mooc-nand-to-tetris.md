Summary: TIL about nand2tertis and this is my attempt at following along the Coursera MOOC


[Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is an interesting book/teaching aid that I had heard of before, but couldn't quite find the time to pick up. A few months ago, a [teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTl5wRDT0CU) was uploaded announcing that material from this book would be adapted into a [Coursera MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). This piqued my interest. I would be following along this MOOC in a self paced manner and uploading code to my personal [repo](https://github.com/bhargavbhat/nand2tetris) as I go along.

I would starting with `Unit 0 : Introduction` and `Unit 1 : Boolean Functions & Logic Gates` today. I would update the repo with the code as I progress along.
