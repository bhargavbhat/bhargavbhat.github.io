Summary: TIL mbed simulator online tool

Today, I came across the online simulator for mbed, available [here](https://simulator.mbed.com/). Although it is currently marked as "experimental", this simulator is pretty full featured and allows developers to test their mbed OS 5 applications without really having to go thru the while code-build-flash-test cycle. Although it doesn't claim to be cycle-accurate, it is really a handy way to test code written against mbed and also for learning/lab environments where this tool can definitely reduce the need for physical devkits or boards.

The tool was announced earlier this year during the mbed conference and details about the tool are available [here](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/introducing-mbed-simulator/). The associated [code repo](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-connect-2018-simulator) has a bunch of interesting samples including ones that demonstrate the networking capabilities of the simulator.
