Summary: Notes and observations after working for 6 months at a startup 

_In Jul 2016, I switched to a new role as a Tech Lead at an Internet of Things (IoT) focused startup. Prior to this, my career was with MNCs of various sizes. This is a reflection of the change 6months into the new company_

This past July, I finally made the plunge and joined a startup. The opportunity was too good to pass up - focus on IoT and work on an in-house product as well as helping customers realize thier vision for connected devices and next-gen connectivity technologies. Technically, this was the perfect mix for the stage of career I was at. Now, 6 months on, I am glad to have taken this step.

#### Culture Shock
As someone that was associated with MNCs all throughout their professional career, this switch was somewhat of a culture shock, but in a good way :). The fast-paced, efficiency focused style of working, having only as much process in place as necessary and the constant multi-tasking between unrelated asks was very new. Loosely structured days and a higher level of autonomy were welcome changes as well. Also new was the more-or-less constantly connected nature of the role and the blurring boundaries between "office" and "home". Flex-hours and Work-from-Home (sometimes for an entire week leading upto holidays) was an interesting experience for me. However, all said and done, I really found this new position expanding my horizons on what different styles of working looked like. After a couple of days being confused and bewildered, I was able to get into the groove and it all started feeling natural a couple of weeks in. 

#### Learning

While I'm pretty sure there's a lot more to learn, 6 months in, here's the most impactful learnings since joining this position:

- Plan ahead and communicate prefer communication over written medium : Flex-time and WFH make this more or less essential for communication outside of scheduled meetings and Agile ceremonies

- Constant Adaptation : Even with a good plan in place, things outside one's control will force change in course. The only way forward is to adapt constantly

- Failure is an Option : In certain contexts, it is definitely preferable to fail fast and course correct rather than spend precious few resources on big obstacles

- Multi-tasking : While most professionals will multi-task on a daily basis, the range or breadth of tasks would be rather limited. This is not really the case in a startup with limited engineering staff and multiple unrealted programs running in parallel.

- Learning on the Job : is more or less a requirement and combined with constant adaptation and accepting & moving on from failures, one's learning is accelerated manyfold.


#### Road Ahead

This journey has just started for me professionally and I'm sure there is a lot more this onion than the few layers I've managed to peel as yet. From guiding & mentoring to leading and working through people, there is a lot more for me to discover.
