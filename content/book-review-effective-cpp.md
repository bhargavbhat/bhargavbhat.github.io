Summary: My review of the Effective C++ book

With more of my day-to-day work moving to C++, I was looking for a nice book to help me get upto speed with C++, best practices and some of the gotchas that C++ is ~famous~ infamous for. This book in particular had rave reviews and was recommended by multiple people, with colleagues, former colleagues and internet strangers all saying very good things about it. I purchased by copy from Sapna Book House about 2 months ago and have been reading it on and off since. I just finished the last topic ("Item 55") a few hours ago.

The copy I have with me is a 2008 reprint of the 3rd edition of this book (ISBN: 978-81-317-1480-5). The book is a paperback, printed paper is of good quality and highlighting does not ghost or show thru. No complaints on the paper or binding quality. The book has held up well.

With regard to content, the book is divided into multiple sections and each section has a bunch of topics. Discussion is presented as an ordered list of "Item"s. 
This makes it very easy to pause and take a break between topics and get back to the book right after what you'd already read. 
Unfortunately, there weren't any exercises apart from a few teasers before gotchas that served as prompts for the reader to think things through and form a view before the "big reveal" of the gotcha and an explaination of why the compiler/language behaved the way it did. This was a deviation from perhaps some of the "textbook" style books that I had read so far, including K&R, which had really great compliment of thought provoking exercises.

Of the 55 Items presented, the following were the most relevant to me, someone who was "migrating" to C++ from C:

- Item 2  : Prefer `const`s, `enum`s and `inline`s to `#define`s 
- Item 5  : Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls
- Item 8  : Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors
- Item 9  : Never call virtual fucntions during construction and destruction
- Item 14 : Think carefully about copying behaviour in resource managing classes
- Item 19 : Treat class design as type design
- Item 26 : Postpone variable definitions
- Item 27 : Minimize Casting
- Item 32 : Make sure public inheritance models "is-a"
- Item 41 : Understand implicit interfaces and compile-time polymorphism
- Item 48 : Be aware of template metaprogramming
- Item 54 : Familiarize yourself with the standard library

The items were relatively independent that I could jump around the book and cover them in this order, having to refer back to other sections and items occasionally. This lent the book being a very easy read, although some of the material presented was a little tricky and I had to try a couple of short programs on my own to really "get" the material.

Overall, I'd say the book lived up to the excellent reviews and positive feedback from colleagues and I would gladly recommend it to someone in my shoes :). I would definitely consider reading more books from Scott Meyers. viz. : More Effective C++ and Effective STL which I understand are presented in a similar format and cover much of the same material.
