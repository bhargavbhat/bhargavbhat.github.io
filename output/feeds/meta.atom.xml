&lt;h4&gt;Installation &amp;amp; Theme Selection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican install was very quick and straight forward process, just follow the instructions laid out in the "quickstart" section of the docs and a fully functional, ready to serve blog was ready on my local machine. This also allowed me to try out a few themes, verify formatting (most of the posts I have were written a email, text files or shared docs, not markdown) and ensure that everything looked fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme selection was a slighly longer task, mostly consisted of &lt;a href="http://www.pelicanthemes.com/"&gt;browsing&lt;/a&gt; available options, trawling the respective github repos and picking one that clicked visually and feature-wise. Then came the testing phase of trying it on the articles and pages that I had migrated/created so far. My main criteria for theme selection were a clean design, pleasing colours, tags &amp;amp; categories support along with a search function. Although I couldn't find one that checked all the boxes, I found that &lt;a href="https://github.com/laughk/pelican-hss"&gt;pelican-hss&lt;/a&gt; had all that I wanted (save the search function). I picked that theme, made a few tweaks to the supplied pygments CSS and &lt;code&gt;base.html&lt;/code&gt; template and decided to call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deployment to Github Pages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous homepage was a rather simple landing page, with links to social media profiles:
&lt;img alt="Previous Homepage" src="/images/home_page.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this was served out of github pages as a simple &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file, forked from the html5up repo. Moving to pelican meant setting up branches slightly differently. I chose to use the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; branch to contain all of the Pelican stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real power, flexibility &amp;amp; convenience of static hosting is apparent from all of the personal blogs and project pages hosted on GH pages. For me, a lot of the learning was around pelican,setting up venv right and migrating content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Road Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my old notes, shared docs and learning are still scattered all over platforms. Although not too many public/shared posts and notes exist, I still have to sift through them all, deal with dead links and filter out stuff that's relevant and applicable to a wider audience. Most of the notes that I have are specific to the particular teams, products or siutations. I've gotten thru a few of these notes and will continue to add them to the site as fast as I can. As I make my way around this old stuff, a lot more posts should start popping up on the homepage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Dates and stuff for these old posts is from file meta data, may not be 100% accurate. Stuff that was once WIP has likely been abandoned and/or is no longer relevant. Links have been updated and dead links removed (where applicable). If you find something odd or inaccurate, please do reach out. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="meta"></category></entry></feed>
