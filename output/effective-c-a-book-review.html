    <p>With more of my day-to-day work moving to C++, I was looking for a nice book to help me get upto speed with C++, best practices and some of the gotchas that C++ is ~famous~ infamous for. This book in particular had rave reviews and was recommended by multiple people, with colleagues, former colleagues and internet strangers all saying very good things about it. I purchased by copy from Sapna Book House about 2 months ago and have been reading it on and off since. I just finished the last topic ("Item 55") a few hours ago.</p>
<p>The copy I have with me is a 2008 reprint of the 3rd edition of this book (ISBN: 978-81-317-1480-5). The book is a paperback, printed paper is of good quality and highlighting does not ghost or show thru. No complaints on the paper or binding quality. The book has held up well.</p>
<p>With regard to content, the book is divided into multiple sections and each section has a bunch of topics. Discussion is presented as an ordered list of "Item"s. 
This makes it very easy to pause and take a break between topics and get back to the book right after what you'd already read. 
Unfortunately, there weren't any exercises apart from a few teasers before gotchas that served as prompts for the reader to think things through and form a view before the "big reveal" of the gotcha and an explaination of why the compiler/language behaved the way it did. This was a deviation from perhaps some of the "textbook" style books that I had read so far, including K&amp;R, which had really great compliment of thought provoking exercises.</p>
<p>Of the 55 Items presented, the following were the most relevant to me, someone who was "migrating" to C++ from C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 2  : Prefer <code>const</code>s, <code>enum</code>s and <code>inline</code>s to <code>#define</code>s </li>
<li>Item 5  : Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls</li>
<li>Item 8  : Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors</li>
<li>Item 9  : Never call virtual fucntions during construction and destruction</li>
<li>Item 14 : Think carefully about copying behaviour in resource managing classes</li>
<li>Item 19 : Treat class design as type design</li>
<li>Item 26 : Postpone variable definitions</li>
<li>Item 27 : Minimize Casting</li>
<li>Item 32 : Make sure public inheritance models "is-a"</li>
<li>Item 41 : Understand implicit interfaces and compile-time polymorphism</li>
<li>Item 48 : Be aware of template metaprogramming</li>
<li>Item 54 : Familiarize yourself with the standard library</li>
</ul>
<p>The items were relatively independent that I could jump around the book and cover them in this order, having to refer back to other sections and items occasionally. This lent the book being a very easy read, although some of the material presented was a little tricky and I had to try a couple of short programs on my own to really "get" the material.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd say the book lived up to the excellent reviews and positive feedback from colleagues and I would gladly recommend it to someone in my shoes :). I would definitely consider reading more books from Scott Meyers. viz. : More Effective C++ and Effective STL which I understand are presented in a similar format and cover much of the same material. </p>
